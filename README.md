Step 1: Data Cleaning 🧹
The project began with an extensive data cleaning process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. I carefully organized and formatted the dataset, dealing with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. This step was crucial to lay a solid foundation for the subsequent analyses.

Step 2: Creating Insights with Tableau 📊
Using the powerful data visualization tool Tableau, I crafted an engaging story that brings the rainfall data to life! Here's a glimpse of the three captivating dashboards I created:

1️⃣ Annual Rainfall by Year 📅
I started by visualizing the annual rainfall trends over the years. The line chart showcased the fluctuations in rainfall, highlighting any patterns or anomalies that emerged. The scatter plot provided an in-depth view, revealing the distribution of rainfall for each year. It was fascinating to observe the variations and uncover any potential insights.

2️⃣ Region-wise Rainfall 🗺️
Next, I delved into the geographical aspect of rainfall patterns. Through an interactive map, I displayed the rainfall distribution across different regions of India. The choropleth map effectively visualized the stark differences in rainfall intensity and provided a clear understanding of which regions received higher or lower amounts of rainfall.

3️⃣ Season-wise Rainfall and Monthly Averages 🌦️
To capture the seasonality of rainfall, I created a visual representation of season-wise rainfall. The bar chart showcased the rainfall amounts during different seasons, allowing for a comprehensive comparison. Additionally, I calculated and presented the monthly average rainfall, enabling a more detailed analysis of rainfall patterns throughout the year.

Step 3: Highlighting Insights and Head Map 📈
Within each dashboard, I highlighted key insights and observations, drawing attention to significant trends or anomalies in the data. Moreover, to provide a visual summary of the highest rainfall in each region, I incorporated a structured heat map. This captivating display made it easy to identify the regions that experienced the most abundant rainfall, offering valuable insights at a glance.
